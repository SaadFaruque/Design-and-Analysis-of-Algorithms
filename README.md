# C++ Design and Analysis of Algorithms

In this reposititory I will push all C++ Algorithm projects I have done over the course of my Junior semester as a Computer Science student

## Topics

Topics from Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Professor Phillips include:

* -Implementation of Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and other data strutures
* -Radix Sort and utilizing different data strutures
* -Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, and Hill-Climbing/Greedy algorithms
* -A star search
* -Quad Trees
* -Partial ordering
* -Dependency Graphs and scheduling
* -Dijkstras' algorithm
* -Kmeans clustering
* -Run-length encoding
* -Huffman encoding and decoding
